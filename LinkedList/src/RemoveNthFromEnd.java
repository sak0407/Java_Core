/*
Given a linked list A, remove the B-th node from the end of the list and return its head.
For example, given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and B = 2.
After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.

NOTE: If B is greater than the size of the list, remove the first node of the list.

Try doing it using constant additional space.

Example Input
Input 1:
A = 1->2->3->4->5
B = 2
Input 2:
A = 1
B = 1


Example Output
Output 1:
1->2->3->5
