/*
*
* Given a singly linked list A and an integer B, reverse the nodes of the list B at a time and return the modified linked list.

Problem Constraints
1 <= |A| <= 103

B always divides A
* Input 1:

 A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
 B = 2
Input 2:

 A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
 B = 3
 *
 * Output 1:

 [2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5]
Output 2:

 [3, 2, 1, 6, 5, 4]
 *
 *  For the first example, the list can be reversed in groups of 2.
    [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
 After reversing the K-linked list
    [[2, 1], [4, 3], [6, 5]]
