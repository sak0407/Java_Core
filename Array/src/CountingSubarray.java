/*Given an array A of N non-negative numbers and a non-negative number B,
you need to find the number of subarrays in A with a sum less than B.
We may assume that there is no overflow.

 A = [2, 5, 6]
 B = 10
 The subarrays with sum less than B are {2}, {5}, {6} and {2, 5},
 4
 A = [1, 11, 2, 3, 15]
 B = 10
 The subarrays with sum less than B are {1}, {2}, {3} and {2, 3}
